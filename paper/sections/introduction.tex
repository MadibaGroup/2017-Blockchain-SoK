\section{Introduction (Scott)}

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Bitcoin took the world by storm
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item While there were previous digital currencies, Bitcoin was the first truly successful currency
	\item Strong interest in the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Particularly in the notion that everyone collectively owned the system
	\item Rocketed in value, before recently crashing
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Bitcoin has spawned many competing systems
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Many are financial
	\item Even more systems have explored whether the underlying technologies of Bitcoin can be used in new an interesting ways.
	\end{enumerate}

	\item This has left many researchers, businesses, and governments to ask: (1) what is blockchain and what properties does it provide, (2) would blockchain be useful for the work I am doing, and (3) what are the broad applications of Blockchain.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item There have been some attempts to address these quesitons
		\item Often, these answers are fragmented
		\item Academia often speaks of specific features (ADS, blockchain, consensus), sometimes misses the forest for the trees
		\item Interestingly, a lot of the thought leadership in this area is not from academia, but rather from industry, yet this information is often overlooked by academics
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Academia has excelled at specific problems, and not the vision of this topic
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item In this paper, we attempt to answer these three questions by pulling data from industry
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item We used a grounded theory process to avoid imposing our research bias
		\item Separated out fact from hype from misconceptions (which were rather rare and stemmed from a different vocabulary) 
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Contributions
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Identify a clear set of criteria for determining whether Blockchain
		\item Enumerate use cases for Blockchain technology and help prioritize them
		\item Identify open problems regarding Blockchain technology. We also identify Academic work in this area.
	\end{enumerate}
