\begin{abstract}
In this paper we answer four common questions regarding Blockchain technology: (1) what exactly is Blockchain technology, (2) what capabilities does it provide, (3) how does it compare to other approaches (e.g., distributed databases), (4) what are good applications for Blockchain technology.
We accomplish this goal by analyzing a large corpus of data produced by industry using grounded theory.
This method was successfully able to help us separate the though leadership provided by industry in this space from the hype that it also peddles.
Additionally, we identify open research questions related to Blockchain technology and discuss lessons learned from our analysis of this space.
