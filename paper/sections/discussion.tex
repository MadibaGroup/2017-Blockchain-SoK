Fast/cheap is because of deregulation
	Do things that are legally questionable

Degrees of decentralization
	Single - not really a blockchain, or is it?
	Oligarchy
	Embarrassingly decentralized
	
There are risks of thinking they are the same
	Using blockchain assuming you get normative properties, not just technical properties
	Get saturated on normative properties, ignore the technical properties
	
Blockchain is not only for global system

Lighter options when all of blockchain not needed
	Distributed data sources with auditability/replication
