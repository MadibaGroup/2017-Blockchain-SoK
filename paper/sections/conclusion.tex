\section{Conclusion}

Ultimately, blockchain technology is neither a panacea nor worthless. Instead it is a useful tool in a system developer's toolkit that can be applied when its overhead is justified by the system's needs.
Even though Blockchain technology does not solve all the problems that its  proponents claim it does, we believe that it is a meaningful technology that  will continue to be used in industry and is deserving of some attention by researchers.

Based on our results and experience, we recommend the use of the following 
questions to determine if Blockchain technology would be a good fit for a 
specific project.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Does the system require shared governance?
	\item Does the system require shared operation?
\end{enumerate}

\jnote{The text that differentiated these concepts got cut, perhaps we can recap it in a sentence or two here.}

If the answer to both questions is no, then blockchain's consensus protocol is  likely unnecessary overhead. If the answer to both questions is yes, then blockchain technology is likely a good fit. This is due to the fact that  meaningful shared governance \emph{and} operation requires miners to audit the operations of others and to be able to recover data that a malicious miner might try to delete.

If only shared governance or shared operation is needed, then the following two questions can be used.

\begin{enumerate}[start=3]
	\item Is it necessary to audit the system's provenance?
	\item Is it necessary to prevent malicious data deletion?
\end{enumerate}

If auditability and data replication are critical, blockchain technology should be considered.
