\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we answer three common questions regarding Blockchain technology: (1) what exactly is Blockchain technology, (2) what capabilities does it provide, and (3) what are good applications for Blockchain technology.
We accomplish this goal by analyzing a large corpus of data produced by industry using grounded theory.
This method was successfully able to help us separate the though leadership provided by industry in this space from the hype that it also peddles.

Our results demonstrate that Blockchain technology is not just hype, but that is provides several important properties and can be used in many interesting applications and use cases.
With these technical properties also comes significant overhead: shared governance and operation (i.e., consensus), as well as  a fully replicated, auditable ledger.
As such, Blockchain technology is best suited for situations in which these properties are required and helpful for the given application.

In short, Blockchain technology will be a useful tool to the security community going forward.
Even though it does not solve all the problems that its proponents claim it does, it is deserving of further research and application by security researchers.
