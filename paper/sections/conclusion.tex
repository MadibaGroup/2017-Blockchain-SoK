\section{Conclusion}
Ultimately, Blockchain technology is neither a panacea nor worthless.
Instead it is a useful tool in a system developer's toolkit that can be applied when its overhead is justified by the system's needs.
Even though Blockchain technology does not solve all the problems that its 
proponents claim it does, we believe that it is a meaningful technology that 
will continue to be used in industry and is deserving of some attention by 
researchers.

Based on our results and experience, we recommend the use of the following 
questions to determine if Blockchain technology would be a good fit for a 
specific project.%\footnote{In Appendix~\ref{sec:distributed-comparison} we 
%discuss alternatives to Blockchain technology.}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Does the system require shared governance?
	\item Does the system require shared operation?
\end{enumerate}

If the answer to both questions is no, then Blockchain's consensus protocol is 
likely unnecessary overhead. If the answer to both questions is yes, then 
Blockchain technology is likely a good fit. This is due to the fact that 
meaningful shared governance \emph{and} operation requires miners to audit the 
operations of others and to be able to recover data that a malicious miner 
might try to delete. %(questions 3 and 4 below, respectively).
If only shared governance or shared operation is needed, then the following two 
questions can be used to determine if the auditable ledger and replication, 
respectively, justify the use of Blockchain technology:

\begin{enumerate}[start=3]
	\item Is it necessary to audit the system's provenance?
	\item Is it necessary to prevent malicious data deletion?
\end{enumerate}
