\subsection{Relationship to other distributed systems}
\label{sec:distributed-comparison}
Blockchain technology fits within the broader family of distributed systems.
At the highest level, Blockchain technology is a type of decentralized database.
To help readers situate Blockchain technology within this greater ecosystem we have created a taxonomy and a flowchart based on that taxonomy (see Figure~\ref{fig:blockchainFlowchart}).

The first property in our taxonomy considers who has the authority to manage and update the database: \emph{what is the operation model?} In a singularly governed database (``Singular''), a single entity performs these tasks. Alternatively, the system can use a consensus protocol to allow for shared governance (``Shared'').

Next, we consider the security model by asking \emph{where is the root of trust?}
This refers to the entity or entities that must behave honestly in order for the system to be secure.
In typical database systems, trust is rooted in the maintainer (``Maintainer'')---for example, using AWS cloud storage requires that you trust Amazon.
Alternatively, trust can be rooted in the design of the system itself (``System''), though this is only possible if the system stores sufficient provenance for it to be audited to confirm that the system is functioning as intended.

The next question is \emph{what is auditable?}
In the worst case, nothing is auditable (``Nothing'').
Systems can use an authenticated data structure~\cite{tamassia2003authenticated} to ensure that their current state can be audited (``Current state'').
If the state also contains a history of the system (e.g., a ledger), then the use of an authenticated data structure allows for the provenance of the system to also be audited (``Provenance'').
In both cases, it is necessary that these databases be monitored to ensure that they never enter an invalid state, even temporarily.
In the case of shared operation, the operating entities act as monitors of the current sate during the consensus protocol.

Finally, we can classify systems by asking \emph{what is it resilient against?}
In particular, we considered with three resiliency properties---(1) is it resilient to accidental data loss (``Data loss''), (2) is it possible to detect that data has been malicious altered (``Detect''), (3) and is it possible to prevent malicious updates (``Prevent'').
Replication is a simple solution to prevent against accidental data loss, but by itself it fails to prevent malicious data loss as the malicious changes to the database will also be replicated.
In singular operation, external monitors can help detect malicious data changes, but can only do so after the data has been lost.
In shared operation, the monitors are the operators and malicious deletions and modifications will not be replicated, preventing them from effecting the overall system.
