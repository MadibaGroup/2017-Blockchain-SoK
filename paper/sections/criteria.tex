\section{Lessons Learned (Scott)}

What was missing in the graph?
	Off-chain stapling
	Anonymity
		MPC
		Functional encryption
	Authenticated data structure

Terminology

Normative vs. technical properties
	public participation is a huge normative property. Not gauntleted to be in a Blockchain.
	There are risks of thinking they are the same
		Using blockchain assuming you get normative properties, not just technical properties
		Get saturated on normative properties, ignore the technical properties
	Diffused trust vs. trustfulness
	Decentralization
		Governance and communication are required to be decentralized
		Disintermediation is normative, and may or may not be part of a Blockchain
			There are always intermediaries. Decentralization limits their power.



How do we know which use cases are good fits for Blockchain?
Criteria
	1) Decentralized governance (*)
	2) Auditability
	3) Resiliency	
Is there a question tree we can create?
